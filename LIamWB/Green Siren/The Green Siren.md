The [[Logo|The Green Siren]] is a small chain of coffee and catering shops in central Thu-Ardessar that employs mostly young adventurers who are short on coin. The business started just selling coffee but realized there was a market in joining onto merchant or adventuring parties to serve coffee and confectionary as the wealthiest patrons were frequently seasoned adventurers who oft complained about having to give up the pleasures of the medicinal beverage on their long journeys. Quickly this grew into a protection business as the highest paying adventurers would pay a premium for a barista who could swing a sword or cast a useful spell.
