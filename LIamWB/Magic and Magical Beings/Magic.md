There is energy in all things. Magic is the energy as it's manipulated.

There are 3 ways to harness energy:
- inherent harnessing of their own energies
	- Any creature with inborn magical nature generates and uses it's energy
	- Sorcerer, Shapeshifter
- Environmental; harnessing an external source of magic
	- Wizard, bard, etc
- Extraplanar access
	- Control and use magic through connection to extraplanar sources
	- Cleric, Paladin
	- Permission/communication involved


All energy has an innate nature to it. Magic represents its owner and vice versa. Beings and their environments are deeply intertwined.

Areas that are high in this innate magic can risk the energy coalescing and taking shape in physical reality. "Monsters" may appear in areas like volcanos or graveyards. [[Gods]] are created in this way as well.

Mid and high level magical entities are bound to the high magic environments that they are from.
