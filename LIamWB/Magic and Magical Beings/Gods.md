Gods are extreme concentrations of [[Magic]]. Gods are not inherently divine, rather are extremely powerful magical creatures. Gods do not necessarily possess human-like thought, but as the [[Magic]] interacts with its environment it attunes to it and this includes sentient beings. Gods that have not been worshipped in ages are likely to resemble the non-human environment that they exist in. In turn, gods that are regularly worshipped or interacted with will maintain sturdy, human like temperaments and personalities.

The localized interaction of gods has lead to a wide pantheon where multiple gods representing the same values exist across geography.
