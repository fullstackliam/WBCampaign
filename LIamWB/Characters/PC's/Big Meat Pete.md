Peter the Paladin had finally had a lucky break after the horrible hand he had been dealt in life. 

Raised as a young bull in a minotaur farm he was set to be the best breeding bull the southern “Ram Ranch” ever produced. His physique and genetics were near perfect, from a strong family line what could go wrong?

Pete had very little “Meat”. Too little to breed. He was set to be butchered by the end of the winter. But today the fence was open. Peter ran; out the gate, down the road, across a frozen stream and over the neighbors hormone herb field that he had snacked on as a baby. When he thought he couldn't run any further, and the cold would claim his life before a ranchers blade he came across a humble chapel a few miles away from his birthplace.  

He was welcomed in and trained as a paladin, vowing to never remove his loincloth and be exposed to his dark and tiny secret for his remaining years
